Exercise 1: Inheritance

The AlarmClock class is designed to set and trigger an alarm, with specific behaviours for managing the alarm state. Here is a summary of the provided requirements:

Constructors:

The constructors of AlarmClock are intended for setting the time on the clock, not for directly setting the alarmHours and alarmMinutes fields.
setAlarm() Method:

The setAlarm() method should be implemented to set the values of alarmHours and alarmMinutes fields.
It should check the values provided and throw an IllegalArgumentException with a message of "invalid alarm hours" or "invalid alarm minutes" if the values are not valid.
isRinging() Method:

The isRinging() method should return true if the alarm is ringing and false if it is not.
The alarm transitions from a non-ringing state to a ringing state when the time on the alarm clock reaches the alarm time.
The alarm clock remains in the ringing state for a total of 15 seconds.
display() Method:

The display() method should override the version from Clock and provide visual feedback that the alarm is ringing.
It can use the isRinging() method to determine when the visual feedback should be provided.
After the alarm has rung for a total of 15 seconds, the output should revert to showing only the time.
Output Sample:

A sample output is provided, showing the time leading up to the alarm trigger and displaying "WAKE UP!" when the alarm is ringing.
Testing:

The provided AlarmTest program can be used to check if the implemented code behaves as expected.



Exercise 2: Interfaces

Writer is a class from the Java API, defined in the java.io package. It represents something to which you can write text (standard output, a file, etc).

The purpose of the writeTo method is to write a textual representation of an object to the given Writer. In the case of Money objects, if the amount of money is 2 euros and 7 cents, the string Money: â‚¬2.07 should be written, followed by a newline character. In the case of Circle objects, if the circle radius is 1.5, the string Circle: r=1.5000 should be written, again followed by a newline.

The writeTo method can potentially throw the checked exception IOException, so you will need to declare this fact using an exception specification.



Exercise 3: ArrayList & Reading From Files

The provided Java class, named Dataset, is designed to store numbers from a file using an ArrayList. The constructor of the class reads numbers from a file specified as a parameter. The class includes methods to determine the size of the dataset and calculate the mean value of the stored numbers. Here is a summary of the requirements:

Constructor:

The constructor populates the ArrayList by reading numbers from a file.
It uses either a Scanner with a Path object or a Scanner with a File object.
The constructor specifies that it can throw IOException, and it does not catch any exceptions internally.
size() Method:

The size() method is implemented to return the number of values stored in the list (size of the ArrayList).
meanValue() Method:

The meanValue() method is implemented to compute and return the arithmetic mean of the stored values.
If there are no stored values, the method throws an instance of ArithmeticException to prevent an invalid calculation.
Testing:

To test the class, the provided ComputeMean.java program is used. It computes the mean value of numbers stored in a file using the Dataset class.
The program is compiled and executed with a file parameter (data.txt), and the expected output includes the dataset size and mean value.
